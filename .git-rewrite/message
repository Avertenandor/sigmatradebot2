Implement orphaned deposit cleanup and manual cancellation (CRITICAL priority)

Added comprehensive system to handle deposits that never receive funds:

1. Automatic Cleanup:
   - Created cleanupOrphanedDeposits() to find pending deposits without tx_hash older than 24h
   - Marks expired deposits as FAILED
   - Notifies users when their deposit request expires
   - Integrated periodic cleanup job into blockchain monitoring service (runs hourly)

2. Manual Cancellation:
   - Added cancelPendingDeposit() for user-initiated cancellation
   - Only allows cancellation before funds are sent (no tx_hash)
   - Modified handleCheckPendingDeposits() to show cancel buttons
   - Created handleCancelDeposit() handler with proper validation
   - Registered cancel_deposit callback action

This prevents database clutter from abandoned deposit requests and gives users control over their pending deposits.
